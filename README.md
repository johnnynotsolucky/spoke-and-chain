![Spoke & Chain homepage](https://github.com/craftcms/spoke-and-chain/raw/stable/web/assets/volumes/images/Logos/logo.png)

## Overview

Spoke & Chain is a fictitious bicycle shop custom-built to demonstrate [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) and [Craft Commerce](https://craftcms.com/commerce). This repository houses the source code for our demo, which you can spin up for yourself by visiting [craftcms.com/demo](https://craftcms.com/demo?kind=spokeandchain).

We‚Äôve also included instructions below for setting up the demo in a local development environment with [DDEV](https://ddev.com/).

Spoke & Chain shows core Craft CMS features and a fully-configured Craft Commerce store:

- Articles and pages with custom layouts and flexible content.
- Front-end global search for products and articles.
- Categorized products with variants, categories, filtering, and sorting.
- Customer membership area with subscription-based services, order tracking and returns, and account management.
- Full, customized checkout process with coupon codes.
- Configured for healthy SEO and built targeting WCAG AA compliance.

## Local Development

### Environment

If you‚Äôd like to get Spoke & Chain running in a local environment, we recommend using [DDEV](https://ddev.com):

1. Clone the Spoke & Chain repository to your system.
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:craftcms/spoke-and-chain.git spokeandchain && cd spokeandchain
   ```
2. Start the DDEV project for the repo:
   ```sh
   ddev  start
   ```
3. Install the Composer dependencies:
   ```sh
   ddev composer install
   ```
4. Create your `.env` file:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Set the application ID and security key:
   ```sh
   ddev craft setup/keys
   ```
6. Restore the initial database
   ```sh
   ddev import-db --file seed.sql.gz
   ```
7. Optionally seed demo data:
   ```sh
   ddev craft demos/seed
   ```
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è The Craft site is offline by default, and the seeder turns it on when it‚Äôs finished. If you skip this step, you‚Äôll need to manually bring the site online by navigating to **Settings** ‚Üí **General Settings** and switching **System Status** to ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù.
8. Add a Craft account for yourself by following the prompts:
   ```sh
   ddev craft users/create --admin
   ```
9. Launch the admin
   ```sh
   ddev launch admin
   ```

> üí° If you‚Äôre using a different local environment, see Craft‚Äôs [Server Requirements](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/requirements.html) and [Installation Instructions](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/installation.html).

### Front End

Run `npm ci` with node 12. (If you‚Äôve installed [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) run `nvm use`, then `npm ci`.)

If you‚Äôve chosen a different environment setup, make sure your `.env` is configured for it. These environment variables are specifically used by `webpack-dev-server`:

- `DEVSERVER_PUBLIC`
- `DEVSERVER_PORT`
- `DEVSERVER_HOST`
- `TWIGPACK_MANIFEST_PATH`
- `TWIGPACK_PUBLIC_PATH`

You can then run any of the development scripts found in `package.json`:

- `npm run serve` to build and automatically run webpack with hot module reloading for local development
- `npm run build` to build front end assets for production

> üí° When using `npm run serve`, switch your site‚Äôs URL from `https://` to `http://`.

#### PurgeCSS

This project uses PurgeCSS to automatically remove redundant or unused styles generated by Tailwind CSS.

PurgeCSS is disabled by default for the `serve` script, meaning your site will be loaded with every available CSS class. It also means you‚Äôll need to check the site after running `build` to be sure important classes aren‚Äôt inadvertently stripped away.

Classes actively being used should be detected automatically, but you can encourage them to be recognized by making sure full class names appear in your template, stylesheet, and JavaScript files.

‚ùå For example, don‚Äôt dynamically combine `text-red-` with a variable for this loop:

```twig
{% set classes = ['100', '500', '900'] %}
{% for class in classes %}
  <div class="text-red-{{ class }}"></div>	
{% endfor %}
```

‚úÖ Loop through complete class names like so they each appear in full:
```twig
{% set classes = ['text-red-100', 'text-red-500', 'text-red-900'] %}
{% for class in classes %}
  <div class="{{ class }}"></div>	
{% endfor %}
```

If you can‚Äôt avoid programmatic concatenation, use Tailwind‚Äôs [safelist](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#safelisting-specific-classes) option in `tailwind.config.js`.

### Testing

Cypress tests cover multiple parts of the website:

- **control panel** ‚Äì make sure the content structure is properly defined.
- **front end** ‚Äì check that the website‚Äôs different sections work as expected.
- **accessibility** ‚Äì evaluate the website for WCAG 2.0 compliance.

Set the environment variables Cypress needs to run by copying `cypress.example.json` to `cypress.json` and adjusting it:

```sh
cp cypress.config.example.js cypress.config.js
```

Open the Cypress Test Runner from the project root:

```sh
npx cypress open
```

Run accessibility tests only:

```sh
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/front/a11y/*.cy.js"
```

### Code Quality

This project uses Foster Commerce configs of the following tools:

- [ECS](https://github.com/FosterCommerce/ecs)
- [Rector](https://github.com/FosterCommerce/rector)

It also has config for the following tools:

- [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)

These are installed with composer and can be run using `composer run-script <tool>`. See the `scripts` section in the composer.json file.

#### Running locally

##### PHPStan

**Target PHPStan level:** 9

```bash
composer run-script phpstan
```

Will output changes that can be made, but will not make the fixes automatically.

###### Stubs

In this project, PHPStan requires generated stubs. These are actually copied from the `storage/runtime/compiled_classes/CustomFieldBehavior_xxxx.php` file. A
script is available to do this for us:

```bash
composer run-script generate-stubs
```

This should be run whenever custom field types on elements are not resolving.

##### ECS

**Note:** ECS changes are relatively safe and are generally cleanup/formatting type changes. It is still recommended to review any changes made by ECS before committing.

To check for ECS changes, run:

```bash
composer run-script ecs:check
```

To apply any fixes use:

```bash
composer run-script ecs:fix
```

##### Rector

**Warning:** Rector changes are destructive and need to be thoroughly reviewed. Blindly committing changes made by Rector is discouraged.

Similary to ECS, to check for and review possible changes, run:

```bash
composer run-script rector:dry-run
```

And to apply changes:

```bash
composer run-script rector:fix
```
